Case I. "Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel"
I. Assuming that the marketing specialist begins his trip from his home in Riverside and returns home daily, the number of variations would be 6. The reason being is the variations of the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products each can have 2 different routes a piece. There is a total of 3 cities, and 3 multiplied by 2 is 6. For example, if he starts in Riverside traveling through Moreno Valley, Perris, then Hemet that is one route; another route being starting in Riverside traveling through Perris, Moreno Valley and ending his last visit in Hemet.

II.The breadth first search would be Riverside to Hemet to Moreno Valley to Perris and back to Riverside. The shortest path, considering he goes through all cities would be starting at Riverside, to Moreno Valley, to Perris and lastly visiting Hemet. This amounts to 74 miles, which would indeed be the shortest path. The most low-cost trip for the marketing specialist would be equivalent to the shortest path. If he were going through all cities, starting at Riverside and ending in Hemet, with the following miles Riverside to Moreno Valley (22 mi), Moreno Valley to Perris (20 mi), and Perris to Hemet (32 mi), being in 74 miles. On the other hand, if he were just visiting one city for example, the most low-cost trip would then be Moreno Valley to Perris at 20 miles.
